# TurbulenceDataset
Turbulence dataset with Images and Cn2 values

We have used two datasets to train/test the model(the July dataset and October Dataset). Each dataset contains around 30k images. All those images were taken with the Nikon P100 DSLR camera at 60fps at a distance of 750m~1500m from the camera. We used a scintillometer to measure the turbulence strength.


The code for the model is available as a Jupyter notebook on the Github at this  [link](https://github.com/Riponcs/Cn2Estimation/blob/main/Turbulence%20Strength%20Estimation%20from%20Video.ipynb).

The Paper link will be updated upon publication of the paper.
